# Active-Directory

## Objective
This lab walked through the steps of Installing and configuring Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team. 
Explore how a domain environment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the real world to help me detect them in the future.
