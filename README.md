# Active-Directory

## Objective
This lab walked through the steps of Installing and configuring Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team. 
Explore how a domain environment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the real world to help me detect them in the future. 
I was inspired by myDFIR found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OessbOgyEo&list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ&index=13&ab_channel=MyDFIR)

Windows Server Administration: I learned the basics of installing, configuring, and managing a Windows Server machine.
    - Active Directory Domain Services  (ADDS)
    - Domain promotion
     
Directory Services: Gained hands-on experience with Active Directory.
    - Creating and managing user accounts, groups, permissions, and group policies in a Windows domain environment.

Networking Concepts: Setting up AD involves understanding networking concepts like DNS (Domain Name System) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

Log Management: Splunk is a powerful SIEM tool for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing machine-generated data (logs). 
    - Ingest logs from various sources, create dashboards, and identify security events.
    
Data Analysis: Splunk uses a query language to search and analyze data. 
    - Improved my problem-solving skills and ability to extract insights from large datasets.

Security Fundamentals: These tools are focused on penetration testing and security assessments. 
    - Learned about common vulnerabilities, exploit tools, and security best practices for hardening Active Directory environments.

Ethical Hacking: This involved testing my test environment system's security posture with permission. 
    - Gained experience in identifying weaknesses in my AD setup and understanding how attackers might target it.
