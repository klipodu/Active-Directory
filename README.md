# Active-Directory

## Objective
This lab walked through the steps of Installing and configuring Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team. 
Explore how a domain environment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the real world to help me detect them in the future. 
I was inspired by myDFIR found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OessbOgyEo&list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ&index=13&ab_channel=MyDFIR)

**Windows Server Administration:** I learned the basics of installing, configuring, and managing a Windows Server machine. <br>
    - Active Directory Domain Services  (ADDS)  <br>
    - Domain promotion  <br>
     
**Directory Services:** Gained hands-on experience with Active Directory. <br>
    - Creating and managing user accounts, groups, permissions, and group policies in a Windows domain environment. <br>

<br> 

<br> **Networking Concepts:** Setting up AD involves understanding networking concepts like DNS (Domain Name System) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).<br>

<br> **Log Management:** Splunk is a powerful SIEM tool for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing machine-generated data (logs).  <br>
    - Ingest logs from various sources, create dashboards, and identify security events.<br>
    
<br> **Data Analysis:** Splunk uses a query language to search and analyze data. <br>
    - Improved my problem-solving skills and ability to extract insights from large datasets.<br><br>

<br> **Security Fundamentals:** These tools are focused on penetration testing and security assessments. <br>
    - Learned about common vulnerabilities, exploit tools, and security best practices for hardening Active Directory environments.<br>

<br> **Ethical Hacking:** This involved testing my test environment system's security posture with permission. <br>
    - Gained experience in identifying weaknesses in my AD setup and understanding how attackers might target it.<br><br>
